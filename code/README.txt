The application and sample code were targeted for an environment that included JBoss 4.0.x (www.jboss.org), Apache Derby 10.0.2.1 (db.apache.org/derby) and an SMTP server. Therefore you will need these applications installed and configured. See appendix A for configuring Apache Derby 4.0.x and appendix B and chapter 10 for configuring JBoss.

Most of these chapters include an enterprise application archieve (ear) for easy installation.

To use these applications in a development environment, you will also need WTP, Eclipse 3.1, WTP dependencies, XDoclet and the JBoss plugin. See chapter 6 for installation details.
